Bri - Sat 19 Aug 2023 (morning)
- Finished project proposal .txt file as well as general wireframe and schema of TrailBlaze.
- Uploaded schema and wireframe to main branch.

Tristan - August 19th 3PM
Created the models for users, posts, comments

Ibrahim - aug 20- 3am

created map controller and model, renamed trailblaze schema to trailblaze
added map_id to markers in schema (think it will be simpler this way)
updated requirements.txt
pushed to main and closed the branch

Ibrahim - aug 20- 2pm

moved flask_app and server.py up in the folder directory because i think theyre supposed to live in the main directory
put the project log and project proposal into trailblaze folder- let me know if you guys disagree with the decision.

Ibrahim - aug20- 2:13pm

put an 'env-trailblaze' folder into the main directory; this way when we start working on the project we just have to type 'source env-trailblaze/bin/activate' in terminal to start the virtual environment. 
updated requirements.txt accordingly, you can install all of the dependencies by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the terminal after getting into the virtual env. 
changed the default port to 8000 since we have 2 mac users, make sure you go to localhost:8000 after you run the server

- Updated template renderings using Template Inheritance to maintain one component and just conditionally render nav bars and content based on the user's actions and (eventually) session.

Bugs to Fix:

- removed delete markers functionality in js because of redundancy (clear does the same thing)
- map creation now functional, first map will always be Godspeed, username
- existing map dropdown works accordingly and redirects to the correct map


Bri - 22 Aug, 1:40pm

- revamped styling in newmap.html to support responsiveness
    - this meant moving the location search input and btns to the top of the #mapwrapper in its own section above the map and table
